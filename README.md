For this app, the goal was to break the UI into various components, manage component state, and respond to user events using React.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

* The app renders 12 different characters from Disney's Zootopia onto the screen.

* Each time the user clicks an image, the characters shuffle. The goal is to click a new character each time - without clicking the same one twice.

* The nav bar at the top keeps track of the user's score. 
  * If you get 12 points, that means you have clicked all 12 characters without clicking the same character more than once, and you've won the game. 
  * If you click the same character twice, the score resets.
  * The score in the nav bar also keeps track of the highest score since the page has been refreshed.
